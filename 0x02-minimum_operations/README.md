# Min Operations Project

This project contains a Python script that calculates the minimum number of operations 
to achieve exactly `n` characters in a text file, starting with a single 'H'.
The only allowed operations are "Copy All" and "Paste".

## Usage

To run the script, execute the following command:

```bash
./0-minoperations.py
