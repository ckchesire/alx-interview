# 0x05. N Queens

This project solves the N Queens problem using a backtracking algorithm in Python.
The goal is to place `N` non-attacking queens on an `N×N` chessboard such that no
two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. The program accepts a single 
command-line argument `N` (an integer ≥ 4), and prints all valid solutions as lists 
of queen positions. It handles input validation and only uses the `sys` module for 
argument parsing.

The challenge emphasizes: 
- Understanding of recursive backtracking
- List manipulations, and 
- Command-line argument handling. 

It offers practical experience in algorithmic thinking, problem-solving, and writing
clean, efficient Python code. Each solution is printed line by line, and there is no
requirement to follow a specific order.
