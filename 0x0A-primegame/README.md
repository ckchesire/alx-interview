## 0x0A. Prime Game

This project simulates a two-player turn-based game involving the strategic removal of prime numbers and their multiples from a set of consecutive integers. The game requires efficient identification of prime numbers, which is achieved using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm. The players take turns, and the winner is determined based on optimal play, applying fundamental game theory principles. To enhance performance, dynamic programming or memoization may be utilized to avoid redundant calculations. The implementation is done in Python 3.4.3, following PEP8 coding standards.
